# News-Scrapping-Tool
The application pulls news from the site https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/rss.cms and displays the headline of the top story in each category.\
v1.0 only scrapes the data once and displays the resulting headlines.\
v2.0 builds upon the above and displays a top story whenever a new one is uploaded on the website.
